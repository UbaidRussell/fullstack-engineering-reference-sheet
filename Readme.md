    ## What is Full stack devlopment?

    Full stack development is the development of both front end and back end of a website or Web application. Front end is the part of the website that the user interacts with and back end is the part of the website that the user does not see. As a full stack engineer it is important to know both front end and back end technologies in order to create solutions for a client or any problem that you are trying to solve. In fact, full stack engineering is one of the most in demand jobs in the tech industry given that you have to know a very wide range of technologies and tools. In this repository are some of the technologies that you need to know in order to be a full stack engineer and how to use them. We'll be getting into frontend development, backend development and databases, in the future we might even get into devops, cloud computing, mobile app development and even machine learning and AI. So stay tuned for that. If you're interested give this repository a star and follow me on [Github](https://github.com/UbaidRussell). I'll be updating this repository regularly with new content. So let's get started.

    ## HTML

HTML is a markup language that is used to create the structure of a website. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. This language is used to make the skeleton of a website. It is the foundation of all websites on the internet. It creates things like the headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, forms, images, videos, audios, links, buttons and much more. HTML is the first thing that you need to learn in order to become a full stack engineer. HTML is a very easy  to learn and it is very easy to understand and use. When a website is made with nothing but HTML, it looks like [this](https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html): ![This is the first website that was ever created and it was made with HTML only.](./images/Webiste%20with%20only%20HTML.png)

### The heading Element in HTML
As you can see in the image above, the first thing we see on the page before everything is the heading, in HTML we use the heading element to create a heading. There are 6 different heading elements in HTML. They are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6. The h1 element is the biggest heading and the h6 element is the smallest heading. The h1 element is used for the main heading of the page and the h2 element is used for the sub heading of the page and so on. Here is an example of how to use the heading element in HTML:

```html
<h1>This is the h1 heading</h1>
<h2>This is the h2 heading</h2>
<h3>This is the h3 heading</h3>
<h4>This is the h4 heaing</h4>
<h5>This is the h5 heading</h5>
<h6>This is the h6 heading</h6>
```
This outputs the following result:
<h1>This is the h1 heading</h1>
<h2>This is the h2 heading</h2>
<h3>This is the h3 heading</h3>
<h4>This is the h4 heaing</h4>
<h5>This is the h5 heading</h5>
<h6>This is the h6 heading</h6>
