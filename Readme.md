    ## What is Full stack devlopment?

    Full stack development is the development of both front end and back end of a website or Web application. Front end is the part of the website that the user interacts with and back end is the part of the website that the user does not see. As a full stack engineer it is important to know both front end and back end technologies in order to create solutions for a client or any problem that you are trying to solve. In fact, full stack engineering is one of the most in demand jobs in the tech industry given that you have to know a very wide range of technologies and tools. In this repository are some of the technologies that you need to know in order to be a full stack engineer and how to use them. We'll be getting into frontend development, backend development and databases, in the future we might even get into devops, cloud computing, mobile app development and even machine learning and AI. So stay tuned for that. If you're interested give this repository a star and follow me on [Github](https://github.com/UbaidRussell). I'll be updating this repository regularly with new content. So let's get started.
